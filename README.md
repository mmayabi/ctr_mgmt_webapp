### Video Demo:  [<URL HERE>](https://youtu.be/_XIxBIAo1vI)

### Description:
As the developer of this web application, I am excited to share that it provides a comprehensive solution for managing Docker containers and images. Our users can easily register and start earning credits for running and creating containers. They can also share their images with others and connect to their containers through a user-friendly browser interface. 

Our application is designed to make containerization more accessible and streamlined, even for users who are new to Docker. We are committed to continuously improving and enhancing the application's functionality, so stay tuned for upcoming updates and improvements!

### Project structure:
I use finance project ui for my project and change it as I need to. I user flask framework and docker-python library. My major goals for this project are to become familiar with Docker and its api for python.

### How to use:
After users login, they can see shared docker images and they can also share their own images too. For adding new image they have 2 options, pull or build it. for pulling image they just need to enter the repository and tag their own image, and to build it they need to upload Dockerfile.

On the container page, users can see a list of their containers. Users can stop, start, remove and attach to the container. Users can add new containers based on shared images. Each user has a credit for running container, of if it finishes, they can add a new one. One other point is that the images are share but containers are specific to the user.
